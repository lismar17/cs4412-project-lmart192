Project Title: Identifying Streaming Behavior Across Attributes of
Region and Genre
Description: 
Understanding patterns in music streaming plat-
forms allows labels and artists to visualize how their music is most
listened to. Clustering streams by genre and sorting by region
enables companies to establish a strategic domain impact. Using
data gathered by Atharva Soundankar, this research utilizes
the FP-Growth association rule to discover possible connection
between location and genre of song streamed. As many columns
exist in the dataset, the research also uses dimensionality re-
duction to focus on important variables, such as rating, amount
streamed, and genre.
